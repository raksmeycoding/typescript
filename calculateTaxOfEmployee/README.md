Hello everyone, here is the first homework about TypeScript. Please read the instruction carefully so that you won't miss any parts.

- Create an interface called Taxable which contains a function that takes bonus (i.e. \$500 bonus) as its parameter.
- Create gender by using Type alias
- Create a Person class that contains the following properties (name, gender, age, display()) and declare those properties as private
- Create another class which is called Employee that extends and implements from the above class and interface respectively and this class contains position, salary, tax, netSalary, displayEmployee() as its own properties, and overrides a function from the interface above.

Note that :

- In the displayEmployee() method, just print out the position and salary.
- In the display() method, if the gender is female, the output should be (.... she is ....) and in contrast, ( ..... he is .....) (check the attached file to see more details)
- For another function that is from the interface, you will have to check even if he gets the bonus or not. If there is a bonus, you must add it to the salary before deducting the tax and print out the net salary after deducting the tax.
- Please set the tax rate to 10% in the code
- No need to take input from the command line, just hardcode the values in the code
- Just submit one typescript file
